# Federated Classification in Hyperbolic Spaces

An efficient method for federated classification in hyperbolic spaces, as introduced in our paper:

- [arXiv 2023] [Federated Classification in Hyperbolic Spaces via Secure Aggregation of Convex Hulls](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06895)

For the single-cell embeddings used in our paper, please refer to [sc-mvae](https://github.com/thupchnsky/sc_mvae).

## Example Usage

Please see the shell files for more details.

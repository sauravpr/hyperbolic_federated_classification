# Federated Classification in Hyperbolic Spaces

An efficient method for federated classification in hyperbolic spaces, as introduced in our paper:

- [TMLR 2024] [Federated Classification in Hyperbolic Spaces via Secure Aggregation of Convex Hulls](https://openreview.net/forum?id=umggDfMHha)

For the single-cell embeddings used in our paper, please refer to [sc-mvae](https://github.com/thupchnsky/sc_mvae).

## Example Usage

Please see the shell files for more details.

## Contact

Please contact Saurav Prakash (sauravp2@illinois.edu) and Chao Pan (chaopan2@illinois.edu) if you have any questions.
